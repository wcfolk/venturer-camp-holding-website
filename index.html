            <p>Venturer Camp 2023 took place from 5 to 12 August 2023 at <a href="https://biblins.org.uk">Biblins Youth Campsite</a>, a site managed by <a href="https://woodcraft.org.uk">Woodcraft Folk</a>. We engaged 300 young people aged 13 to 17 for a week of camping taking in the lovely surroundings of the Wye Valley, enjoying workshops and socialising with friends old and new.</p>
            <p>We attracted lots of press interest throughout the week. <a href="https://www.thenews.coop/172385/topic/youth/hundreds-of-young-people-embrace-co-operation-at-woodcraft-folk-summer-camp/">Coop News  published </a> a review of the event and <a href="https://www.rossgazette.com/news/woodcraft-folk-is-offering-over-400-teenagers-challenging-yet-enriching-activities-630658">The Ross Gazette published a piece </a> at the start of the event looking forward to the exciting things we were bringing to the valley!</p>
            <p>Have I mentioned yet that there's another Venturer Camp just around the corner. In 2026, Venturer Camp will be back - engaging even more young people for <em>their</em> Venturer Camp experience.</p>
